Notes on policy and reminders:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Individual assignments:} Assignments in this course should be
    completed individually.
    You may discuss questions with your peers, but you must arrive at solutions
    on your own and based on your own understanding.
  \item Questions throughout this course will encourage reflection and creative
    thinking regarding problems at hand.
    To encourage engagement, the instructors may sometimes share examples of
    your solutions that they find particularly creative or interesting
    \emph{anonymously} with the class
    (you may of course take credit for any such solution if you wish).
